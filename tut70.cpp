#include <iostream>

// Containers in C++
// A container is a holder object that stores a collection of other objects. They are implemented as class templates, which allows great flexibility in the types supported as elements.

// Sequential Containers - Sequence containers implement data structures that can be accessed sequentially. e.g. - array, vector, deque, forward_list, list
// Associative Containers - Associative containers implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity). e.g. - set, map, multiset, multimap
// Unordered Associative Containers - Unordered associative containers implement unsorted (hashed) data structures that can be quickly searched (O(1) amortized, O(n) worst-case complexity). e.g. - unordered_set, unordered_map, unordered_multiset, unordered_multimap
// Container Adapters - Container adapters provide a different interface for sequential containers. e.g. - stack, queue, priority_queue
