The class which inherits the base class has all members of a base class as well as can also have some additional properties. The Base class members and member functions are inherited to Object of the derived class. A base class is also called parent class or superclass. 
    // Derived Class: A class that is created from an existing class. The derived class inherits all members and member functions of a base class. The derived class can have more functionality with respect to the Base class and can easily access the Base class. A Derived class is also called a child class or subclass.
